 * <b>[MEDIUM] Question: <b/>Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
 * You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
 * <p/>
 * The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of
 * three different numbers that is why it is called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem>Dutch National Flag</a> problem.
