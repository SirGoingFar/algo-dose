A call service provider bills its customer on the post-paid plan monthly for all the calls made in the just concluded month.

The call session log sent to the customer (in an invoice) consists of newline-separated records for all the calls made
- as shown below:

"03:26:05;0909-367-932
00:26:05;0909-357-932
02:26:05;0907-367-932
04:26:05;0909-367-932
03:26:05;0909-367-932"

Each call session record has a format "hh:mm:ss;phone_number": where "hh:mm:ss" represents the call duration and "phone_number"
is the dialed contact number.

To confirm that the bill charged by the call service provider is same as the amount of call time used,
write a function that computes the total cost of all the call sessions according to the following provider policy:

- Each second of a call costs 3 kobo
- For a call session of 5 minutes or more, each initiated call minute costs 150 kobo
- The phone number with the highest call duration qualifies for the provider free call promo.
In a case where two phone numbers have same call durations, the phone number whose digit sum is smaller qualifies for the promo.
